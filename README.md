Professional Music Production

My name is Chris White
I'm 36-years-old.
I grew up in Memphis Tennessee with a love of music, sports and video games.

My first experience with making music came with a free version of Fruity Loops. I grew up loving hip-hop, rock, indie, pop and some country. 
I like the way harmonic movement can communicate complex emotional ideas to the listener. I am a former linguist that loves and respects what different cultures have to offer and I love to explore themes and cultures across the world.
