Professional Music Production

My name is Chris White
I'm 36-years-old.
I grew up in Memphis Tennessee with a love of music, sports and video games.

My first experience with making music came with a free version of Fruity Loops. I grew up loving hip-hop, rock, indie, pop and some country. 
I like the way harmonic movement can communicate complex emotional ideas to the listener. I am a former linguist that loves and respects what different cultures have to offer and I love to explore themes and cultures across the world. 

I started actively pursuing a career in music when I got out of the military a decade ago. I am graduating Full Sail University with a bachelors in Music Production in June 2023. 

I want to compose music for music libraries, score for film and tv as well as explore the world of video game music production. I'd love to make custom beats for aspiring musicians and I love working in any genre but most of my experience is in hip-hop.
